<h1>Sol 1.3.4</h1>
<h3><font color='#888888'>SUNRISE AND SUNSET DASHBOARD WIDGET</font></h3>

Sol is a Dashboard widget that tells you what time sunrise and sunset are, as well as dawn and dusk.<br>
<br>
<p align='center'><img src='http://solwidget.googlecode.com/git-history/www/widget.png' /></p>

The analog display is a 24-hour clock, with noon at the top and midnight at the bottom. The dark region is nighttime, the light part is daytime, and the slivers in between are dawn and dusk. (Or, for the technically inclined, they are <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_twilight'>civil twilight</a>.)<br>
<br>
<p><br /></p>

<h2>Details</h2>

See the <a href='http://solwidget.googlecode.com/git-history/www/About.html'>very detailed About page</a> for further details.<br>
<br>
<p><br /></p>

<h2>Building</h2>

If you <a href='http://code.google.com/p/solwidget/source/checkout'>get the source code</a>, be sure to read the <a href='http://solwidget.googlecode.com/git/README.txt'>README.txt</a> file in the top level directory for build instructions.<br>
<br>
<p><br /></p>

<h2>Submit a Translation</h2>

If you would like to submit a new language translation for Sol, please <a href='http://code.google.com/p/solwidget/issues/entry'>create a new Issue</a> and select the <i>New Language Translation</i> template and enter the translations there.  Alternatively grab a copy of <a href='http://code.google.com/p/solwidget/source/browse/widget/localizations/fr.lproj/LocalizedStrings.js'>one of the existing translations</a>, modify it to have the translations for new language and email it to me together with the language name.<br>
<br>
<p><br /></p>

<h2>About the <i>Apple - Downloads - Dashboard</i> Listing</h2>

Apparently shortly after the release of the Mac App Store (with Mac OS X version 10.6.6 on 2011-01-06), it became impossible to submit any further updates to the <i><a href='http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/'>Apple - Downloads - Dashboard</a></i> site.  As a result, downloading the Sol widget from there (Sol can be found in the <i>Information</i> category) is now stuck permanently pointing to the Sol-1.3.1.wdgt.zip download.  For this reason, the Sol-1.3.1.wdgt.zip download has actually been replaced with the most recent Sol version (currently 1.3.4) as of the time (2014-01-15) that the ability to update these downloads was disabled.<br>
